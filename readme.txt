host-meta for WordPress!

== Description ==

This plugin provides a host-meta - file for WordPress (RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6415).

From the RFC:

> Web-based protocols often require the discovery of host policy or metadata, where host is not a single resource but the entity controlling the collection of resources identified by URIs with a common host as defined.  While these protocols have a wide range of metadata needs, they often define metadata that is concise, has simple syntax requirements, and can benefit from storing its metadata in a common location used by other related protocols.

> Because there is no URI or a resource available to describe a host, many of the methods used for associating per-resource metadata (such as HTTP headers) are not available.  This often leads to the overloading of the root HTTP resource (e.g. 'http://example.com/') with host metadata that is not specific to the root resource (e.g. a home page or web application), and which often has nothing to do it.

> This memo registers the "well-known" URI suffix 'host-meta' in the Well-Known URI Registry established by, and specifies a simple, general-purpose metadata document for hosts, to be used by multiple Web-based protocols.

Backup your site completely before proceeding.

To install a WordPress Plugin manually:

    * Download from [the WordPress directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-meta/)
    * Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-host-meta/releases)
* If downloaded as a zip archive, extract the Plugin folder to your desktop.
* With your FTP program, upload the Plugin folder to the `wp-content/plugins` folder in your WordPress directory online.
* Go to [Plugins screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Screens#Plugins) and find the newly uploaded Plugin in the list.
